    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oatmeal is an oatmeal-based, oatmeal-like mush made of cooked oats.</p> 
    <p>You might like it.</p>
    <p>If you don't like it don't force yourself to eat it. Find something else to eat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oats</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Whatever else you want in your oatmeal</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put water in a pot</li>
        <li>Put oats in the water in the pot</li>
        <li>Heat up the water in the pot (this also heats up the oats)</li>
        <li>Stop heating up the water when you feel like you want to eat the oats</li>
        <li>Wait a minute</li>
        <li>Eat the oats</li>
        <li>At some point in the process outlined above add whatever else you want to put in the oatmeal into the pot with the water and the oats</li>

        <ul>
            <li>I am not you, nor am I your mother. I cannot tell you what you might like to eat in your oatmeal. Take some responsibility.</li>
        </ul>

    </ol>
